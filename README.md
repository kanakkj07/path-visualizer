Welcome to Shortest Path Finder Visualizer, an interactive tool to visualize different pathfinding algorithms right in your browser!!

 **Features:-**

BFS (Breadth-First Search) – Explores paths in layers.

DFS (Depth-First Search) – Explores paths deeply before backtracking.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Finds the shortest path using weighted distances.

A Search Algorithm* – Uses heuristics for efficient pathfinding.

**How to Play**

Click on a grid cell to set the start point (green).

Click on another cell to set the end point (red).

Click and drag to place walls (gray).

Click one of the algorithm buttons to begin visualization.

Click "Clear Grid" to reset and try again!

**Controls**

Left Click: Set start, end, or wall cells.

Mouse Drag: Create walls quickly.

Algorithm Buttons: Start different pathfinding methods.

Clear Button: Reset the grid.

**How It Works**

The grid is a 20x20 interactive matrix.

Algorithms run in real-time, visually highlighting visited nodes and the final path.

Yellow cells represent explored nodes, and blue cells indicate the shortest path.
